# ðŸ”¬ Microbiome-Metabolite Analysis via Redundancy Analysis (RDA)

This section investigates how gut microbiota at the **genus level** and **metabolite profiles** are associated across different BMI categories (**Normal, Overweight, Obese**), using **Redundancy Analysis (RDA)** in R.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Workflow Summary

### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Load genus-level counts and filter to 55 metabolomics-matched samples.
- Add pseudocount (+1) to avoid `log(0)`, then apply CLR transformation using `compositions::clr()`.
- Load pre-scaled metabolomics data (`metabo_scaled`) from `sPLSDA.RData`.

### Step 2: Redundancy Analysis (RDA)
- Fit the RDA model using:
  - **Response:** `metabo_scaled` (log-transformed and scaled)
  - **Explanatory:** `Group` from metadata (BMI group)
- Evaluate:
  - Model summary and adjusted RÂ²
  - Canonical coefficients
  - Variance partitioning: constrained vs. unconstrained

### Step 3: Statistical Testing
- Run permutation-based ANOVA using `vegan::anova.cca()`:
  - Overall model significance
  - Individual constrained axes (e.g., RDA1, RDA2)
  - Group term significance

### Step 4: Visualization
- Use a custom `rda_plot()` function to:
  - Plot samples (colored by BMI group)
  - Plot top contributing features (metabolites/genus)
  - Color arrows by feature type:
    - Genus: **purple** (`#660099`)
    - Positive ions: **green** (`#228B22`)
    - Negative ions: **red** (`#e02b35`)
  - Supports:
    - **Scaling 1:** Sample distances
    - **Scaling 2:** Feature correlations
- Combine plots using `gridExtra::grid.arrange()`

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Interpretation

- RDA quantifies how much variance in the multi-omics dataset is explained by BMI group.
- Permutation-based ANOVA tests:
  - Overall model significance
  - Significance of RDA axes (e.g., RDA1, RDA2)
  - Group effect (BMI categories: **N**, **OW**, **OB**)
- Adjusted RÂ² provides a corrected measure of explanatory power and prevents overfitting.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Outputs

- `rda_plot()` produces informative biplots with:
  - Sample points (colored by BMI group)
  - Top features as arrows (arrow length reflects contribution)
  - Switchable between:
    - **Scaling 1** â€” emphasizes sample distances
    - **Scaling 2** â€” emphasizes feature correlations

**Arrow Colors**
